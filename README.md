## Hi, I'm Ahmed 👋

💡 Data Analyst & Builder of Practical Tools  
I enjoy turning messy data into clear, simple insight and building small, useful apps that save people time.  
My background combines **banking & fintech analytics**, **data science**, and **hands-on software projects** in Python and Android.

- 🤖 **Machine Learning for Customer Behaviour** – churn, segmentation, forecasting  
- 🧰 **Productivity Tools** – desktop apps like Text File Searcher, file comparators, and PDF utilities  
- 📱 **Android Apps** – Kotlin apps like ScholarBio and a crossword puzzle game

- Python, SQL, Kotlin, Java (basics), Bash (basics)
- ML/AI: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow basics, Pandas, NumPy , Matplotlib
- Other Tools: Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook , pycharm, Microsoft SQL, NoSQL (Mongo DB)
  
**Data & Machine Learning**  
- pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn  
- Data cleaning and feature engineering  
- Classification, regression, customer churn models  
- Visualisation with Matplotlib / Power BI

**Analytics, Reporting & Databases**  
- Power BI, Excel (advanced), CSV/Excel data preparation  
- Relational databases and querying with SQL

**Software & App Development**

### 🚀 Selected Projects

- 🧭 **Text File Searcher** – Search across .txt files with a simple Tkinter GUI  
- 🧾 **DataPrep-Pro** – Clean, prepare, and explore datasets faster  
- 🧱 **TextFileCompareApp** – Compare contents of two text files side by side  
- 📄 **HexaPDF Editor** – Lightweight PDF editing/annotation tool  
- 🎓 **ScholarBio (Android)** – Kotlin app with modern Android stack  
- 🧩 **Crossword Game (Android)** – 1000-word, 100-level crossword with themes and progress tracking  

> Many of these are available in my repos here on GitHub.

### 🌱 What drives me

I like **building things that are actually used** – tools that make data work easier for analysts, students, and developers.  
I’m especially interested in:

- Using **ML to understand customer behaviour** and reduce churn  
- Turning raw transactional data into **clear, decision-ready insight**  
- Sharing my work openly so others can learn from real-world projects

I learn and build continuously, and I’m slowly shaping this profile into a **portfolio for data, ML, and fintech-related work**.
